# mcbookdel

This little utility does exactly what it suppose to, nothing more. This contrasts brightly with tools like `powertoys` which have much bloat (useless features, UI, etc.), while not even being able to remap system keys.

`mcbookdel` remaps `Right Option` key for Windows `DEL` key in your Bootcamp OS. So now you can finally use proper Delete key with single key press (albeit in a bit weird position)!
As a bonus, it also remaps `Right Command` key as `Middle Mouse Button` key, which is very useful when you don't have proper mouse connected to your Mac/MacBook.

_Note: to work properly in all programs it must run with elevated permissions (Admin Mode). Autostart is implemented as automatic creation of Task Scheduler entry._
